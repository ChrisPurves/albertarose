							<img class="right" src="images/barn_mountain.jpg" alt="barn with mountains in background">
							<p>Canada is the 2<sup>nd</sup> largest country in the world with a population of approximately 35 million.  It is one of the best places in the world to live as it is one of the most peaceful countries in the world where diversity is not only accepted but encouraged.  Canada is fast becoming the country of choice for international students because of:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>While we have a small higher education service compared to other nations, Canada’s post-secondary education universities rank among the highest world-wide.  Canada has some of the lowest tuition costs in the world, a lower cost of living (as compared to the UK, the US and Australia) and still offers quality for less.</li>
								<li>According to UN sources, Canada is considered one of the most liveable countries to live in.  We are among the happiest, most peaceful nations in the world with a high standard of living, high life expectancy and many social programs.</li>
								<li>Canada has one of the best health care systems in the world where health care is affordable because of provincial health care initiatives.  Some provinces provide basic health care services to their international students free of charge.</li>
								<li>Multiculturalism is a national policy, not just a concept so Canada welcomes immigrants from all over the world.  One out of every 6<sup>th</sup> person in Canada is an immigrant.</li>
								<li>Work opportunities await the international student and students are permitted to work part-time while studying to offset some of the expenses of studying in Canada.  Government work programs also encourage international students to stay in Canada and work after their graduation from a Canadian university or college.</li>
								<li>Practical training is an integrate part of studying in Canada so students get the opportunity to have hands-on training related to their study program.</li>
							</ul>
							<h2 id="aboutUniversities">About Universities & Colleges in Canada</h2>
							<img class="left" src="images/ucalgary.jpg" alt="university of Calgary">
							<p>You can study at some of the best world-class universities and colleges in Canada.  The government of Canada heavily funds its educational systems, especially at the post-secondary level.  Therefore public universities and colleges in Canada are among the best places in the world to study at.  In 2013, <span class="highlight">23 of Canada’s universities ranked in the top 500 universities in the world</span>; as per the recently published Academic Ranking of World Universities.  Obtaining a degree from a Canadian institution provides you with a world-recognised degree.</p>
							<p>Many scholarships, grants and funding opportunities are available to international students.  Canada has a work program that allows students to work up to 20 hours per week during their studies to help cover the cost of living while going to a university or college in Canada.</p>
							<p>Some of the colleges and universities that we work closely with are the <a href="http://www.ualberta.ca">University of Alberta</a> (in the top 100 in world rankings), <a href="http://www.macewan.ca">Grant MacEwan University</a>, <a href="http://www.douglas.bc.ca">Douglas College</a> and <a href="http://www.georgiancollege.ca">Georgian College</a>; but we are not limited to these institutions and are able to process applications to study at many other colleges and universities in Canada.</p>

							<h1 id="IELTSPrep">IELTS Exam Preparation</h1>
							<img class="right" src="images/explaining.jpg" alt="speaking with students">
							<p>If you are planning to emigrate to an English speaking country, whether for studies or for immigration, then you will most likely have to write the IELTS exam or one of the other English Proficiency exams.  Alberta Rose Education Centre provides IELTS Exam Preparation Courses at their Lahore, Pakistan location.  The experienced IELTS teacher is a 2 degree holder from a Canadian university and is a native English speaker who can capably coach you in the 4 components on the General and Academic IELTS exam.</p>
							<h2 id="whyIELTS">Why Write the IELTS Exam?</h2>
							<p>Unless you are a student who has received excellent marks in O Level English Literature under the Cambridge System, or if you have gone to an English medium school or university in Pakistan, you will <strong>HAVE</strong> to write the IELTS, or another English language proficiency testing exam.  The colleges and universities in Canada, or other countries where you want to study need to know your level of English Language Proficiency (ELP) in order to consider your eligibility for one of their study programs.  A test like the IELTS Exam helps them in their decision making.</p>
							<p>Even if you have studied in an English medium system, you may want to consider writing the exam or receive training in an IELTS Exam Preparation course as it hones your academic English language skills.</p>
							<h2 id="whyIELTSPrep">Why Take the IELTS Exam Preparation Course?</h2>
							<p>Most students in Pakistan, even if they have studied in an English medium school or university do not have sufficient familiarity in English to function well in English speaking academic settings.  Most students cannot write as well as is expected for a college or university in an English speaking country such as Canada.  Therefore, for your benefit, to obtain high marks and achieve full success at an institution in Canada, or internationally, it is advisable to get IELTS coaching and/or write the exam from a native English speaker who can train you in all aspects of academic English language proficiency.</p>
							<p>The full 30 lesson IELTS Exam Preparation Course covers the Listening, Reading, Writing and Speaking components of the exam.  Many students find that they benefit from the full course, although the course can be streamlined to coach you in the areas which you need most.  For example, if you are strong in listening, but weak in writing, you can take only that portion of the course to improve in your weakest area.</p>

							<h2 id="ELPTest">ELP Measurement Test</h2>
							<p>Write this short assessment to find out if you should take the course and/or write the exam.  You will get a personalised response to writing this assessment test. (For Pakistan students only)</p>
