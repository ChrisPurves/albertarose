							<p>Ms. Khan has over 30 years of experience in the Post-Secondary Education in Canada. She spent 27 years working for the University of Alberta before moving to Pakistan where she now provides information about and services on behalf of UAlberta and Western.</p>
                                                        <p>For several years she managed the University of Alberta’s portfolio but in 2017 took on Western as well. After a rigorous on-campus training, she is qualified to provide information and services to students who are interested in studying in Western University, Ontario. She meets with students, visits schools and participates in Pakistan’s National International Education exhibitions.</p>
                                                        <p>Canada is her forte. She has the knowledge and capability to assist students who desire to apply to one of these two universities. Not only does she have the Canadian post-secondary education background, but she is also well-versed in Pakistan’s various curricula and how they are accepted at a world-ranked Canadian university. Having knowledge in both Pakistan’s and Canada’s education system means you get the best information and assistance possible.</p>

                                                        <p>Canada is the 2<sup>nd</sup> largest country in the world with a population of approximately 35 million. It is one of the best places in the world to live as it is one of the world’s most peaceful countries where diversity is not only accepted but encouraged at the national level. Canada is fast becoming the country of choice for international students because:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Canada’s post-secondary education universities rank among the highest world-wide. Four of its universities are in the top 100 worldwide and 5 rank in the 101-200 range. Canadian universities are top-notch because the government spends a high percentage of its GDP on post-secondary education.</li>
								<li>Canada has some of the lowest tuition costs in the world, a lower cost of living (as compared to the UK, the US and Australia) and still offers quality for less. It is value for your dollar.</li>
								<li>According to UN sources, Canada is considered one of the most liveable countries to live in. It is among the happiest, most peaceful nations in the world with a high standard of living, high life expectancy and many social programs.</li>
								<li>Canada has one of the best health care systems in the world where health care is affordable because of provincial health care initiatives. Some provinces provide basic health care services to their international students free of charge.</li>
								<li>Multiculturalism is a national policy, not just a concept, so Canada welcomes immigrants from all over the world. One out of every 6 people in Canada is an immigrant.</li>
								<li>Work opportunities await the international student, and students are permitted to work part-time while studying to offset some of the expenses of studying in Canada. Government work programs also encourage international students to stay in Canada and work after their graduation from a Canadian university or college.</li>
                                                                <li>Practical training is an integrated part of studying in Canada so students get the opportunity to have hands-on training related to their study program through Co-op Work Experience and Internships.</li>

							<h2 id="aboutHerServices">About Her Services</h2>
							<img class="right" src="images/explaining.jpg" alt="speaking with students">

                                                        <p class='postscript'>Please note that Ms. Khan is not a visa consultant, but an educationalist. She can point you to the correct website and How-To-Apply sites, but she will not apply for a study permit on your behalf. Students do not need visa consultants; in fact, the Canadian government states that explicitly on their website. Applying for a study permit on your own is not hard; it is something you are capable of doing. But if you do want to use a consultant please make sure that person is licensed with the Canadian government’s Department of Immigration, Refugees & Citizenship Canada, <a href='http://secure.iccrc-crcic.ca/search-new/EN'>IRCC</a>. This regulatory board ensures that licensed visa consultants have the expertise required to provide consultancy services and <a href='http://iccrc-crcic.info/find-a-professional/'>IRCC members</a> are accountable for their practices. This regulatory council is not just for Canadians but visa practitioners anywhere in the world are required to hold a license and be a member of IRCC. So even if you are living in Pakistan and looking for a qualified visa consultant, please refer to this registry of authorised visa consultants.</p>
